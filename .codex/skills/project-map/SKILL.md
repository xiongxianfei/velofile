description: >
  Build or refresh a high-level map of an existing repository. Use when the agent or reviewer cannot clearly see architecture, module boundaries, data flow, runtime flow, test layout, ownership, or where a change belongs.

# Project map

You are creating architecture visibility for humans and agents before detailed design or implementation.

This skill is for orientation. It should describe what exists today, not invent a future design.

## When to use

Use when:

- the user says architecture is unclear;
- a change crosses modules or services;
- the repo is brownfield and the agent lacks context;
- tests or CI are hard to locate;
- ownership, boundaries, or runtime flow are ambiguous;
- before `architecture` for a high-risk change.

## Inputs to read

Read, if present:

- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CONSTITUTION.md`
- `docs/`
- `specs/`
- package/build files
- source tree structure
- test tree structure
- CI workflows
- deployment or infrastructure files
- module boundaries, public interfaces, API routes, data models, schemas, migrations

Inspect actual files, not just names, when drawing conclusions.

## Output path

Prefer:

```text
docs/project-map.md
```

For a narrower area, use:

```text
docs/project-map/<area>.md
```

## Required sections

1. **Purpose and scope**: what this map covers and what it does not cover.
2. **System overview**: major modules, packages, services, or apps.
3. **Repository layout**: important directories and their responsibilities.
4. **Runtime flow**: entry points, request/event/job flow, background work.
5. **Data flow**: main entities, storage, schemas, serialization boundaries.
6. **External boundaries**: APIs, SDKs, third-party services, platform dependencies.
7. **Test map**: where unit, integration, end-to-end, smoke, and fixture tests live.
8. **CI/release map**: relevant workflows and verification commands.
9. **Architecture rules observed**: patterns the code already follows.
10. **Risk areas**: coupling, unclear ownership, missing tests, fragile boundaries.
11. **Open questions**: things the map could not determine confidently.

## Diagrams

Use Mermaid when it helps. Prefer simple diagrams:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  User --> EntryPoint
  EntryPoint --> Domain
  Domain --> Storage
  Domain --> ExternalService
```

Do not create decorative diagrams. Every node should help someone implement or review safely.

## Rules

- Separate observed facts from inferences.
- Cite file paths for important claims.
- Do not propose implementation changes unless asked; record opportunities under risk areas.
- Do not overfit the map to the current requested feature.
- Keep the map stable enough for future work.

## Evidence collection efficiency

Use summary and stable-ID first reasoning before broad reads or raw excerpts. Prefer check IDs, requirement IDs, test IDs, file paths, counts, and line citations when inspecting large files, repeated scans, generated output, or validation output. Read exact ranges after locating relevant lines, then expand only when the narrower evidence is insufficient.

## When full-file read is required

Read the full file when the whole file is the review target, the relevant section cannot be isolated safely, surrounding context can change the conclusion, bounded searches disagree or produce incomplete evidence, or a behavior-changing edit depends on the whole source-of-truth artifact.

## Expected output

- created or updated project map path;
- concise architecture overview;
- key boundaries and flows;
- test and CI orientation;
- risks and open questions;
- recommended next skill, usually `explore`, `proposal`, or `architecture`.
