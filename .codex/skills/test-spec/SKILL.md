# Test spec authoring

You are designing the proof before implementation.

The test spec defines how the team will know the implementation satisfies the behavioral contract.

## Inputs to read

Read:

- approved feature spec;
- spec-review findings;
- architecture doc and ADRs when relevant;
- concrete execution plan;
- `AGENTS.md` and `CONSTITUTION.md` if present;
- existing test conventions, fixtures, helpers, and CI commands;
- related tests for similar behavior.

## Output path

Prefer:

```text
specs/slug.test.md
```

## Required sections

1. **Status**: draft, active, abandoned, superseded, archived.
2. **Related spec and plan**.
3. **Testing strategy**: unit, integration, end-to-end, smoke, manual, contract, migration.
4. **Requirement coverage map**: every requirement ID maps to one or more tests or explicit manual verification.
5. **Example coverage map**: every example maps to a test when feasible.
6. **Edge case coverage**.
7. **Test cases** with stable IDs.
8. **Fixtures and data**.
9. **Mocking/stubbing policy**.
10. **Migration or compatibility tests** when relevant.
11. **Observability verification** when logs, metrics, traces, or audit events are required.
12. **Security/privacy verification** when relevant.
13. **Performance checks** when relevant.
14. **Manual QA checklist** when automation is insufficient.
15. **What not to test** and why.
16. **Uncovered gaps** that must return to spec or architecture.
17. **Next artifacts**: planned next steps while the test spec remains draft or active.
18. **Follow-on artifacts**: actual downstream artifacts or terminal disposition. If present before any real follow-ons exist, say `None yet`.
19. **Readiness**: truthful next-stage or active-proof-surface wording.

## Test case format

Use:

```text
T1. Title
- Covers: R1, R3, E2
- Level: unit | integration | e2e | smoke | manual
- Fixture/setup:
- Steps:
- Expected result:
- Failure proves:
- Automation location:
```

## Coverage rules

- Every `MUST` requirement needs coverage.
- Every error behavior needs coverage.
- Every migration or compatibility claim needs coverage or explicit manual verification.
- Every architectural boundary that could break wiring needs an integration or contract test.
- Bugs require a regression test that fails before the fix when feasible.

## Rules

- Do not generate tests from an unreviewed or unstable spec unless using the fast lane and documenting the risk.
- Do not generate tests from a spec-review outcome that explicitly marked eventual `test-spec` readiness as `not-ready` or `not-assessed`.
- Do not invent behavior not specified.
- Do not mark a requirement covered by a test that does not assert it.
- Do not rely only on snapshots for behavioral requirements.
- Do not skip integration tests where the risk is at a boundary.
- Do not use `reviewed` or long-lived `complete` as durable test-spec states. Move from `draft` to `active` when implementation or review is relying on the test spec, then close out to `archived`, `superseded`, or `abandoned` when it is no longer the active proof-planning surface.
- Preserve `Next artifacts` as planning history. Use `Follow-on artifacts` for actual downstream artifacts, replacement, or terminal closeout.
- Do not hide untestable requirements; send them back to `spec-review`.
- Do not treat downstream implementation readiness as a substitute for approved spec-review findings and concrete plan context.
- When changed boundaries still require approved architecture or ADR input, return the work to the appropriate upstream gate instead of guessing.

## Evidence collection efficiency

Use summary and stable-ID first reasoning before broad reads or raw excerpts. Prefer check IDs, requirement IDs, test IDs, file paths, counts, and line citations when inspecting large files, repeated scans, generated output, or validation output. Read exact ranges after locating relevant lines, then expand only when the narrower evidence is insufficient.

## When full-file read is required

Read the full file when the whole file is the review target, the relevant section cannot be isolated safely, surrounding context can change the conclusion, bounded searches disagree or produce incomplete evidence, or a behavior-changing edit depends on the whole source-of-truth artifact.

## Expected output

- test spec path;
- grouped test cases;
- requirement-to-test coverage map;
- fixtures and commands;
- explicit exclusions;
- uncovered gaps, if any;
- readiness statement for `implement`.
