# Independent implementation review

You are reviewing in independent-review mode with fresh eyes.

Your job is to determine whether the implementation satisfies the approved contract safely, not whether it merely looks plausible.

## Inputs to read

Read:

- actual diff or changed files;
- feature spec;
- test spec;
- concrete plan;
- architecture doc and ADRs when relevant;
- plan validation notes;
- test and CI results;
- selector-selected targeted proof, including selected checks and their stable check IDs when the selector is in scope;
- invocation context for `workflow-managed`, isolated, or review-only behavior;
- explicit user instructions to stop after review;
- `AGENTS.md` and `CONSTITUTION.md`;
- related code paths and tests when needed.

Prefer a fresh session, separate reviewer, or separate agent when available. If not, intentionally reset assumptions before reading the diff.

## Independent-review mode

- Ground the review in the actual diff or changed files, approved upstream artifacts, checklist coverage, and available validation evidence.
- Do not treat remembered implementation intent, chat memory, or passing tests alone as sufficient review grounding.
- If you cannot inspect the actual diff, relevant tests, or authoritative upstream artifacts, do not return `clean-with-notes`. Use `changes-requested` or `blocked` when the review surface independently supports a finding; otherwise use `inconclusive`.

## Review surface and tracked governing branch state

- The review surface may be changed files, a staged diff, an unstaged diff, a PR diff, a commit range, an explicit patch, or another local review target.
- Tracked governing branch state is the tracked Git state that can support branch-scoped conclusions about cleanliness, authority, or readiness.
- This review does not require every reviewed implementation change to already be committed.
- If you cite a proposal, spec, test spec, plan, architecture document, or ADR as authoritative support for a clean branch-scoped conclusion, confirm that artifact is present in tracked governing branch state.
- Local-only governing artifacts may inform reviewer background understanding, but they must not support a clean branch-scoped conclusion.

## Mixed-evidence handling

- Missing tracked governing authority blocks `clean-with-notes`.
- Missing tracked governing authority does not suppress independently supported `changes-requested` or `blocked` findings.
- Use `inconclusive` only when missing evidence prevents both a supported finding and a clean conclusion.

## Direct proof for named edge cases

- Clean review conclusions for named edge cases must cite direct proof from a targeted test, targeted validation output, or an explicit manual verification note when manual verification is allowed.
- Code-shape inference alone is insufficient direct proof for a named edge case.
- When a named edge-case proof gap is actionable within approved scope, report it as a finding instead of a clean result.
- When the reviewer cannot inspect enough evidence to assess a named edge case credibly, use `inconclusive` rather than a clean result.
- For validation-routing changes, targeted proof should name selector selected checks from `python scripts/select-validation.py` or `bash scripts/ci.sh --mode explicit`; broad smoke evidence is separate and required only when an authoritative trigger applies.

## First-pass checklist coverage

Evaluate each check with `pass`, `concern`, or `block`, and cite concrete evidence from the diff, tests, or governing artifacts:

1. **Spec alignment**: the changed behavior matches the approved spec and non-goals.
2. **Test coverage**: tests prove the changed behavior and regressions at the right level.
3. **Edge cases**: named edge cases and failure paths are handled as specified.
4. **Error handling**: invalid states, partial failures, permissions, and fallbacks are handled safely.
5. **Architecture boundaries**: the diff respects approved design boundaries and ADR decisions.
6. **Compatibility**: existing workflow expectations, contributor contracts, and migrations remain valid.
7. **Security/privacy**: no secret leakage, unsafe logging, auth bypass, or policy regression.
8. **Generated output drift**: canonical/generated outputs remain synchronized when generation is involved.
9. **Unrelated changes**: the reviewed diff does not quietly include unrelated edits.
10. **Validation evidence**: named commands and results are present, relevant, and credible.

For sensitive change classes, explicitly cite the relevant governing requirements, risks, or checklist items instead of relying on a generic clean summary.

## First-pass statuses

Use exactly one first-pass review status:

- `clean-with-notes`: the review passes and no unresolved accepted fix is required before `verify`.
- `changes-requested`: one or more fixable findings exist within current approved scope and with sufficient evidence to act.
- `blocked`: the review cannot safely auto-enter `review-resolution` under current approved scope without a new decision.
- `inconclusive`: the reviewer cannot inspect enough evidence to produce a credible clean or actionable result.

Issues that are clearly fixable within current approved scope and with sufficient evidence to act use `changes-requested`, not `blocked`.

## Severity

Use:

- `blocker`: unsafe to merge or violates a `MUST`.
- `major`: should be fixed before PR approval.
- `minor`: improvement that does not block.
- `nit`: optional style/readability suggestion.
- `positive`: good pattern worth keeping.

## Material findings

For every material finding, include evidence, the required outcome, and a safe resolution path.

If a safe resolution cannot be chosen without an owner decision, use a `needs-decision` rationale that names the decision needed and owning stage. A material finding lacking evidence, required outcome, or safe resolution or `needs-decision` rationale is incomplete.

When workflow-managed review findings are recorded under `docs/changes/<change-id>/reviews/`, preserve the first-pass review record before fixes and record dispositions in `review-resolution.md`.

## Rules

- Produce a first-pass review record before any review-driven fix is applied or any `review-resolution` work begins.
- The first-pass review record must include: review status, review inputs, diff summary, findings, checklist coverage, no-finding rationale when no findings exist, and recommended next stage.
- Surfacing findings first means the findings are visible before fixes begin. It does not create a new user decision gate unless a stop condition applies.
- This feature does not create a new standalone `review-resolution.md` requirement by itself.
- Do not confuse passing tests with compliance.
- Do not review from memory; use the actual diff.
- Do not request broad rewrites when a targeted fix is enough.
- Do not claim a credible clean result when required evidence or tracked governing authority is missing; use `inconclusive` instead unless the review surface independently supports a finding.
- Do not require positive notes in a clean review. Include them only when they provide specific, evidence-backed information useful to future maintainers.
- Do not emit generic praise such as `looks good` without checklist coverage and no-finding rationale. That is an invalid clean review.
- Do not expose secrets, credentials, or sensitive runtime values from the diff or validation outputs.

## Workflow handoff behavior

- In a workflow-managed full-feature flow, emit the first-pass review record before any review-driven fix begins.
- In a workflow-managed full-feature flow, `clean-with-notes` hands off to `verify` when no stop condition applies.
- In a workflow-managed full-feature flow, `changes-requested` enters the `review-resolution` loop, addresses the findings, and reruns `code-review` when no stop condition applies.
- In a workflow-managed full-feature flow, `blocked` stops and reports the blocker.
- In a workflow-managed full-feature flow, `inconclusive` stops and reports the missing evidence. It does not enter `review-resolution`.
- Stop instead of auto-entering `review-resolution` when the request is review-only, the request is isolated `code-review`, a finding requires a product/spec/architecture/ADR/scope decision, a higher-priority repository policy requires human review, the actual diff/tests/upstream artifacts are unavailable, or the user explicitly asked to stop after review.
- Direct `code-review` requests remain isolated by default unless the user explicitly asks to continue beyond the review result.

## Diff summary

<What changed, based on the actual diff.>

## Findings

No blocking or required-change findings.

## Checklist coverage

| Check | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Spec alignment | pass | <evidence> |
| Test coverage | pass | <evidence> |
| Edge cases | pass | <evidence> |
| Error handling | pass | <evidence> |
| Architecture boundaries | pass | <evidence> |
| Compatibility | pass | <evidence> |
| Security/privacy | pass | <evidence> |
| Generated output drift | pass | <evidence> |
| Unrelated changes | pass | <evidence> |

## No-finding rationale

No blocking findings were found because:

- the diff matches the approved spec and plan scope
- tests cover the changed behavior
- no unrelated files are present in the reviewed diff
- validation evidence supports the implemented behavior

## Residual risks

- None identified.
```

## Evidence collection efficiency

Use summary and stable-ID first reasoning before broad reads or raw excerpts. Prefer check IDs, requirement IDs, test IDs, file paths, counts, and line citations when inspecting large files, repeated scans, generated output, or validation output. Read exact ranges after locating relevant lines, then expand only when the narrower evidence is insufficient.

## When full-file read is required

Read the full file when the whole file is the review target, the relevant section cannot be isolated safely, surrounding context can change the conclusion, bounded searches disagree or produce incomplete evidence, or a behavior-changing edit depends on the whole source-of-truth artifact.

## Expected output

- first-pass review record with:
  - review status using `clean-with-notes`, `changes-requested`, `blocked`, or `inconclusive`;
  - review inputs;
  - diff summary;
- findings with exact file/path references;
- checklist coverage;
- no-finding rationale when applicable;
- any missing tracked governing artifacts or direct-proof gaps that affected the result;
- optional positive notes only when they add specific evidence-backed value; and
- recommended next stage or stop reason.
