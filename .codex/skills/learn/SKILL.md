# Learning and retrospective capture

You are running a learn session only when learning is periodic or explicitly invoked by cadence, incident response, contributor observation, repeated review findings, blocker or major workflow-process findings, failed release or adapter smoke, accepted postmortem action, explicit maintainer request, or another stated trigger.

`learn` is periodic or explicitly invoked. It is not the default final stage for every change, and it blocks downstream only when a higher-priority artifact explicitly makes it blocking. When a trigger occurs, capture the lesson immediately, create a scheduled follow-up, or record an explicit no-learn rationale in the appropriate surface.

Do not fabricate lessons. The trigger decides whether a session may run; evidence decides what the session captures. A single event remains `observation` or `no-durable-lesson` unless the evidence shows a reusable pattern or systemic gap. Maintainer request, incident response, contributor observation, cadence, and explicit invocation do not lower the evidence standard for durable guidance.

Maintainer-driven rule adoption without accumulated evidence is not durable learn capture. If a maintainer proposes or requests a new rule, but the learn session lacks accumulated evidence such as repeated review findings, repeated incidents, failed smoke patterns, recurring validation gaps, or prior session evidence, classify the observation as `direction`, not `durable-lesson`, and route it to proposal work. The proposal may later produce an ADR, workflow spec update, skill change, or other authoritative artifact if accepted. Do not add the rule directly to `docs/learn/topics/<topic>.md` as durable guidance unless there is accumulated evidence or an accepted authoritative artifact to cite.

## Purpose

Capture evidence-bound observations and contributor-confirmed durable lessons without turning learn records into workflow policy, lifecycle closeout, or PR readiness proof.

## When to use

Use this skill only when learning is periodic or explicitly triggered by cadence, incident response, contributor observation, repeated findings, failed smoke, accepted postmortem action, maintainer request, or another stated trigger.

## When not to use

Do not use this skill as the default final stage for every change, to invent a lesson from weak evidence, to create new workflow policy by itself, or to bypass proposal, spec, ADR, workflow, or skill updates when behavior should change.

## Outputs

Produce a learn session record after Frame, topic updates only for contributor-confirmed durable lessons, and links to action-owning artifact updates or follow-ups when routing produces them.

## Handoff

- Normal next stage: none by default; record the session outcome or no-learn rationale and stop.
- Conditional next stages: route confirmed `artifact-update`, `decision`, `direction`, or `process-follow-up` to the owning proposal, ADR, spec, workflow, skill, active plan, issue, or other authoritative artifact.
- For full stage order and downstream-blocking semantics, route through the `workflow` skill.

## Claims this skill must not make

Do not claim:

- new workflow policy is authoritative unless the lesson is routed to and accepted in an authoritative artifact;
- plan closeout, review-resolution closeout, verification readiness, branch readiness, PR readiness, CI status, or derived-artifact currency;
- a single observation is a durable lesson without reusable pattern, systemic gap evidence, contributor confirmation, or accepted authoritative artifact support.

## Output Surfaces

When a learn invocation reaches the Frame phase, create or update a tracked session record at `docs/learn/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. This applies even when the session is empty or produces `no-durable-lesson`.

Use `docs/learn/topics/<topic>.md` only when contributor-confirmed durable guidance justifies a topic entry. Do not pre-create empty topic files, a fixed topic taxonomy, session templates, or topic templates.

The session record is the primary output. It links to every derivative topic entry, action-owning artifact update, ADR, proposal, issue, active-plan follow-up, scheduled follow-up, or explicit no-learn rationale produced by the session.

The boundary is simple: topic files are curated guidance, not policy. They must not override `CONSTITUTION.md`, approved specs, accepted ADRs, approved architecture docs, workflow docs, skill files, accepted proposals, active plans, or action-owning artifacts. If a lesson changes behavior, workflow, architecture, validation, skill behavior, examples, or decisions, update the action-owning artifact and link that update from the session record.

Pre-session trigger closeout is different from a learn session; pre-session trigger closeout may record a scheduled follow-up, deferral, or explicit no-learn rationale only when `learn` does not actually run as a session. Use a contributor-visible tracked or review-visible surface.

## Inputs to read

Start from bounded evidence:

1. trigger statement and named artifacts;
2. relevant `docs/learn/README.md`, prior session records, and topic files when present and relevant;
3. compact summaries, headings, stable IDs, and exact sections first for governance, workflow, spec, plan, ADR, review, verify, incident, commit, derived-artifact, or validation evidence;
4. full-file reads only when narrower evidence is insufficient for classification or routing.

For periodic learn sessions, inspect changes in the selected time window when relevant, including proposals, plans, change packs, ADRs, recent commits to canonical surfaces, and derived-artifact or validation records.

For incident sessions, inspect the incident report, related artifacts, affected specs or plans, review or verify findings, and relevant postmortem action records when present. Summarize sensitive evidence; do not commit secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, private incident data, or unnecessary machine-local details.

For explicit invocations, inspect artifacts named by the user and artifacts implied by the stated pattern.

## Four Phases

Run every learn session in this order: Frame, Observe, Classify, Route.

### Frame

Establish and record:

- trigger and trigger type;
- scope;
- evidence in scope;
- explicit exclusions;
- prior learnings reviewed;
- session record path under `docs/learn/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`.

For periodic learn sessions, also record time window start, time window end, and window basis.

### Observe

Examine the evidence for patterns, surprises, drift, and gaps. Every observation must be evidence-bound.

Before proposing durable guidance, check whether the lesson is already captured in a prior session, topic entry, action-owning artifact, ADR, proposal, active plan, or workflow artifact. If no observations are found, record that explicit no-observation result in the session record.

### Classify

Each observation has exactly one primary classification:

- `observation`
- `durable-lesson`
- `artifact-update`
- `decision`
- `direction`
- `process-follow-up`
- `no-durable-lesson`

An observation may also have secondary routes. Secondary routes are derivative actions or destinations and do not become additional primary classifications.

Record classification decisions with observation ID, proposed primary classification, final primary classification, secondary routes, confirmed-by, and rationale.

Contributor confirmation is required before routing. If confirmation is unavailable, record candidate classifications in the session record and stop before updating topic files, ADRs, proposals, follow-ups, or action-owning artifacts.

### Route

Route only contributor-confirmed final classifications:

- `observation`: keep in the session record only.
- `durable-lesson`: add or update the relevant topic file with date, short lesson, source-session link, primary classification, and secondary routes when present.
- `artifact-update`: update the affected authoritative artifact and link that update from the session record.
- `decision`: create or update the relevant ADR or decision artifact, then link it from the session record and any relevant topic entry.
- `direction`: open a proposal or trackable follow-up; do not encode direction as topic-file policy.
- `process-follow-up`: link an issue when an issue tracker exists, use the active plan when it owns the work, or open a proposal when no tracker or active plan owns it. Do not use `docs/roadmap.md` as the fallback for learn follow-ups.
- `no-durable-lesson`: record the no-learn rationale and whether any follow-up was scheduled in the session record.

## Topic Curation

Topic entries may be added, revised, superseded, removed, or absorbed into an authoritative artifact. When you remove, revise, or absorb an entry, preserve traceability through a session link, authoritative-artifact link, topic-file rationale, or explain-change rationale.

Topic files exist for discovery. Keep them concise and curated; do not let them become policy, workflow contracts, architecture decisions, validation contracts, or skill contracts.

## Stop conditions

Stop before routing or topic updates when:

- the trigger is absent or cannot be stated;
- evidence does not support a durable lesson;
- contributor confirmation is unavailable for final classification;
- the observation requires policy, workflow, architecture, spec, ADR, or skill behavior changes that need an owning artifact;
- sensitive incident details, secrets, credentials, or private data cannot be summarized safely.

## Evidence collection efficiency

Use bounded evidence before broad reads or raw excerpts.
Use summary and stable-ID first reasoning before broad reads or raw excerpts.
Prefer check IDs, requirement IDs, test IDs, file paths, counts, line citations, matching line numbers, diffs, and targeted excerpts when inspecting large files, generated output, validation logs, or repeated scans.
Output caps are safety rails, not evidence-selection strategy.
Validation summaries must not change selected check coverage, command exit behavior, failure detection, or required validation evidence.
Read exact ranges after locating relevant lines, then expand only when the narrower evidence is insufficient.

## When full-file read is required

Read the full file when the whole file is the review target, the relevant section cannot be isolated safely, surrounding context can change the conclusion, bounded searches disagree or produce incomplete evidence, or a behavior-changing edit depends on the whole source-of-truth artifact.

## Rules

- Do not manufacture observations to justify a session.
- Do not capture durable lessons from isolated single events without reusable pattern or systemic gap evidence.
- Do not repeat already-captured lessons.
- Do not make final classification decisions unilaterally.
- Do not route without contributor confirmation.
- Do not bypass downstream review for derivative ADRs, proposals, specs, architecture docs, workflow changes, or skill behavior changes.
- Do not use `learn` as the authoritative owner of plan index state, plan-body lifecycle state, review-resolution closeout, verification readiness, PR readiness, or CI status.
- If nothing durable was learned, record the empty outcome honestly in the session record once Frame has occurred.
