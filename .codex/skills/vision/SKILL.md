# Project Vision

You are producing the document people read first when they encounter this project.

A vision answers: what is this, who is it for, what does it commit to, what does it refuse to become, and how should future proposals be checked for fit.

This is not a proposal, spec, architecture document, roadmap, task tracker, or README maintenance pass. It describes project identity and scope. It does not describe how the project is built.

## Workflow Fit

This skill is upstream of the normal per-change workflow. It does not hand off to another stage on completion.

Use it at project genesis, or when proposal review or learn surfaces a vision-level conflict. Do not run it just because a feature was added, an architecture changed, or README needs ordinary setup instructions.

Future proposals should be checked against `VISION.md` when it exists, but proposal requirements still belong in proposals and specs.

## Inputs To Read

Start with compact project inputs when available:

- `CONSTITUTION.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- README front-matter between `<!-- vision:start -->` and `<!-- vision:end -->`
- existing root `VISION.md`
- legacy root `vision.md` during migration or conflict resolution
- recent proposal summaries, especially proposals that touch scope or direction
- `docs/project-map.md` when it helps project framing
- prior research or exploration artifacts when the workflow already produced them

Use summary and stable-ID first reasoning before broad reads or raw excerpts. Prefer check IDs, requirement IDs, proposal IDs, section names, file paths, counts, and line citations when comparing project direction or repeated artifact scans.

Escalate from compact inputs to broader reads or full-file reads only when compact inputs are missing, conflicting, or insufficient to decide project-level framing.

## Edit Authorization

`CONSTITUTION.md` outranks `VISION.md`.

`VISION.md` is canonical for project-vision content.

`VISION.md` outranks README front-matter. README front-matter is generated from `VISION.md` and is not independently authoritative.

The skill follows state-based behavior from repository state and ordinary user intent. Do not ask users to choose `create`, `revise`, or `mirror` modes.

Do not create the initial `VISION.md` just because this skill is installed or invoked for ordinary README maintenance.

Do not edit README front-matter directly to express a vision change. Edit `VISION.md`, then synchronize README from it.

Ensure existing visions are not overwritten without clear update intent; keep the current file unchanged and ask for clarification before editing.

If both root `vision.md` and root `VISION.md` exist, stop and require an owner decision. Do not merge, delete, or overwrite either file automatically.

## State-Based Behavior

Interpret legacy words such as `create`, `revise`, or `mirror` only as natural-language hints about user intent. Apply the state-based rules below and do not report those words as operating modes.

If no root `VISION.md` exists:

- If legacy root `vision.md` exists and root `VISION.md` does not, treat `vision.md` as migration input. Migration work may rename it to `VISION.md`; do not create a second competing vision file.
- If neither root vision file exists and the user explicitly asks to establish project vision, create root `VISION.md`, generate README front-matter, insert README vision markers when missing using deterministic placement, and report assumptions plus open vision-level questions.
- If the user did not clearly ask to establish project vision, stop and ask whether to create `VISION.md`. Do not edit README while that intent is unclear.

If root `VISION.md` exists and the user asks to update vision:

- Update only the requested section or clearly related sections.
- If a requested change necessarily cascades across sections, state why before finalizing.
- If the section or update intent is unclear, stop and ask for clarification before editing.
- Always ask or confirm whether the change is `substantive` or `editorial` before finalizing, even when the user proposes the classification.
- Treat changes to project scope, target users, commitments, refusals, proposal-fit framing, or falsifiability as substantive unless an owner records a contrary rationale.
- For substantive changes tied to an existing or required change-local pack, require the causal link in `docs/changes/<change-id>/change.yaml` and `docs/changes/<change-id>/explain-change.md` before finalizing.
- Update README front-matter only inside an existing valid marker block.
- When updating an existing `VISION.md` or syncing README, missing or malformed markers stop the skill unless the user explicitly authorizes marker insertion or skipping README synchronization.

If root `VISION.md` exists and the user asks to sync README:

- Leave `VISION.md` unchanged.
- Update README front-matter only inside an existing valid marker block.
- If README front-matter already matches, report that no content changed.
- If README markers are missing, malformed, nested, or duplicated, stop unless the user explicitly authorizes marker insertion.

Editorial updates and README-only synchronization do not require a new change-local pack solely because this skill ran.

## Vision Content

Root `VISION.md` stays at or under 500 words.

Use plain language. Do not use `MUST`, `SHOULD`, or `MAY` as requirements vocabulary in generated or revised vision text.

Do not include feature lists, implementation details, architecture diagrams, status fields, decision logs, stakeholder tables, or priority columns.

Use plain Markdown. `VISION.md` must not require rendered tables, diagrams, HTML layout, or generated assets to be understood.

Include sections, in this order, with plain-language headings:

1. Pitch
2. What makes this different
3. Who it is for
4. Who it is not for
5. What it commits to
6. What it refuses to be
7. What would prove this wrong
8. Open questions, only when vision-level uncertainty remains

Concrete and verifiable language beats abstract claims. Scope refusals should be real enough to guide future proposal decisions.

## Drafting Heuristics

Use these as authoring questions or checks, not additional `VISION.md` sections:

- Differentiator: what alternative class or specific tool is this different from, and what tradeoff does this project make?
- Pain points: are the project pain points embedded in the differentiator instead of presented as an unrelated complaint list?
- Commitments: is each commitment concrete and checkable by a future reviewer?
- Falsifiability: are the failure conditions observable from behavior or artifacts?
- Audience: does the audience statement rule out at least one plausible non-fit?
- Refusals: are scope refusals concrete enough to block misaligned proposals?

The differentiator comparison may name an alternative class or a specific tool. It does not require naming a specific competitor.

## README Front-Matter

README front-matter is bounded by this exact marker pair:

```markdown
<!-- vision:start -->
<!-- vision:end -->
```

Generated README front-matter includes only:

- the pitch
- the differentiator
- the target audience
- a link to `VISION.md` for goals, non-goals, and falsifiability

The front-matter must be derived from `VISION.md`, not independently authored.

Automatic marker insertion is allowed only when creating the initial `VISION.md`.

If README already contains one valid marker block, replace only content inside the marker block and preserve all content outside it.

During initial `VISION.md` creation, if README has no marker block and contains a Markdown H1, insert the marker block immediately after the first H1 block. The first H1 block is the first line matching `# <title>` plus any immediately following badge/image lines or blank lines directly attached to that heading.

During initial `VISION.md` creation, if README has no H1, insert the marker block at the start of the file and preserve existing content after it.

When updating an existing `VISION.md` or syncing README, missing or malformed markers stop the skill before file modification unless the user explicitly authorizes marker insertion or skipping README synchronization.

This is the same gate as existing guidance that says the user explicitly authorizes marker insertion or skipping README mirroring.

If README has malformed, nested, or multiple vision marker pairs, stop and request explicit handling instead of rewriting README broadly.

Do not edit README content outside the marker block except to insert the marker block when initial vision creation or explicit owner authorization allows insertion.

## Security And Research Boundaries

`VISION.md` and generated README front-matter must not include secrets, credentials, private local filesystem paths, private machine names, or personal data not explicitly intended for publication.

If sensitive or private content is present in inputs, omit it or ask for explicit confirmation before including it.

The skill must not fetch external information unless the user explicitly requests research or the workflow invokes a research-backed mode before vision drafting.

If external research is used, distinguish researched facts from project assumptions.

## Rules

- Do not create or update `VISION.md` unless repository state and user intent authorize that edit.
- Do not insert generated README vision front-matter during update or sync unless the user explicitly authorizes marker insertion.
- Do not add a README synchronization helper script as part of this skill.
- Do not make `vision` a normal lifecycle stage.
- Do not silently redefine project vision through README edits.
- Do not let the vision exceed 500 words.
- Do not include implementation detail or architecture content.
- Do not rewrite legacy proposals solely to add `Vision fit` or update historical `vision.md` references.

## Evidence Collection Efficiency

Use summary and stable-ID first reasoning before broad reads or raw excerpts. Prefer check IDs, requirement IDs, proposal IDs, section names, file paths, counts, and line citations when inspecting large files, repeated scans, generated output, or validation output. Read exact ranges after locating relevant lines, then expand only when the narrower evidence is insufficient.

## When full-file read is required

Full-file reads are required when creating or replacing root `VISION.md`, when resolving legacy root `vision.md` migration or both-file conflicts, when the whole file is the review target, when the relevant section cannot be isolated safely, when surrounding context can change the conclusion, when compact inputs are missing or conflicting, when bounded searches disagree or produce incomplete evidence, when README marker placement depends on the whole README structure, or when a behavior-changing edit depends on the whole source-of-truth artifact.

## Expected output

Report:

- Files changed:
- README front-matter: created, replaced, unchanged, skipped, blocked, or not applicable
- Assumptions: required when establishing the initial vision
- Sections changed: required when updating vision
- Revision classification: `substantive` or `editorial`, required when updating vision
- `VISION.md` unchanged: required when syncing README only
- For substantive updates: whether the required causal link was recorded or not required
- open questions suitable for human review before treating the vision as current
