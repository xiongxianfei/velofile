description: >
  Create or update the technical architecture/design artifact after the spec is stable and before execution planning. Use when a change touches multiple components, data flow, persistence, APIs, deployment, performance, security, or long-lived design decisions.

# Architecture and ADR authoring

You are making the technical design visible before implementation.

The architecture artifact explains **how the system should be shaped** to satisfy the spec. It should expose tradeoffs, boundaries, and decisions without becoming a low-level task list.

## Inputs to read

Read, if present:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `CONSTITUTION.md`
- feature spec and spec-review findings
- accepted proposal
- research artifacts
- `docs/project-map.md`
- related architecture docs and ADRs
- existing source interfaces, schemas, APIs, modules, CI, deployment config

## Output paths

Prefer:

```text
docs/architecture/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md
docs/adr/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md
```

Use ADRs for decisions that are long-lived, controversial, high-risk, or likely to be revisited.

## Required architecture sections

1. **Status**: draft, approved, abandoned, superseded, archived.
2. **Related artifacts**: proposal, spec, research, project map.
3. **Summary**: one-paragraph design direction.
4. **Requirements covered**: map requirement IDs to design areas.
5. **Current architecture context**: relevant existing components and constraints.
6. **Proposed architecture**: components, responsibilities, and boundaries.
7. **Data model and data flow**: storage, schemas, events, migrations, ownership.
8. **Control flow**: request, command, job, event, or UI flow.
9. **Interfaces and contracts**: APIs, public types, config, CLI, SDK, UI contracts.
10. **Failure modes**: retries, partial failures, rollback, timeouts, degraded mode.
11. **Security and privacy design**: auth, permissions, secrets, data exposure, auditability.
12. **Performance and scalability**: expected bottlenecks and limits.
13. **Observability**: logs, metrics, traces, alerts, debug surfaces.
14. **Compatibility and migration**: staged rollout, backfill, dual-write/read, downgrade.
15. **Alternatives considered**: at least two alternatives for significant changes.
16. **ADRs**: decisions made, rationale, consequences.
17. **Risks and mitigations**.
18. **Open questions** that must be resolved before plan.
19. **Next artifacts**: planned next steps while the design remains active current guidance.
20. **Follow-on artifacts**: actual downstream artifacts or terminal disposition. If present before any real follow-ons exist, say `None yet`.
21. **Readiness**: truthful next-stage or settled-state wording.

## Diagram guidance

Use Mermaid diagrams when helpful:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Client --> API
  API --> Domain
  Domain --> Database
  Domain --> Queue
```

Keep diagrams small and accurate. Prefer multiple simple diagrams over one unreadable diagram.

## ADR format

Use:

```text
ADR-YYYYMMDD-slug: Title

## Status
draft | proposed | accepted | active | deprecated | superseded | archived | abandoned

## Context

## Decision

## Alternatives considered

## Consequences

## Follow-up
```

For this repository's current ADR contract:

- `draft` and `proposed` are active-work states.
- `accepted` and `active` are settlement states.
- `deprecated`, `superseded`, `archived`, and `abandoned` are terminal or closeout-oriented states.

## Rules

- Do not write an execution milestone list here; use `plan` after design review.
- Do not hide tradeoffs.
- Do not introduce architecture that the spec does not require.
- Do not change behavior in the architecture doc without updating the spec.
- Do not claim compatibility, rollback, or performance safety without explaining the mechanism.
- Do not use `reviewed` as a durable architecture status. Once the design is relied on, normalize the tracked artifact to `approved` or the appropriate terminal state.
- Preserve `Next artifacts` as planning history. Use `Follow-on artifacts` for actual downstream artifacts, replacement, or terminal closeout.
- If an architecture document is superseded, identify the replacement with `superseded_by` or equivalent labeled text.

## Workflow handoff behavior

- In a workflow-managed flow, successful `architecture` completion hands off to `architecture-review` when that review is the next required or default downstream stage.
- If the design still has open questions that block safe review, stop and report the blocker instead of implying `architecture-review` can proceed.
- This v1 contract does not imply `architecture-review -> plan`; review-to-next-authoring transitions remain outside the autoprogression boundary unless a later approved change adds them.

## Evidence collection efficiency

Use summary and stable-ID first reasoning before broad reads or raw excerpts. Prefer check IDs, requirement IDs, test IDs, file paths, counts, and line citations when inspecting large files, repeated scans, generated output, or validation output. Read exact ranges after locating relevant lines, then expand only when the narrower evidence is insufficient.

## When full-file read is required

Read the full file when the whole file is the review target, the relevant section cannot be isolated safely, surrounding context can change the conclusion, bounded searches disagree or produce incomplete evidence, or a behavior-changing edit depends on the whole source-of-truth artifact.

## Expected output

- architecture doc path and ADR paths;
- requirement-to-design mapping;
- diagrams when useful;
- alternatives and decisions;
- risks, migrations, and observability;
- readiness statement for `architecture-review` or blocker state.
