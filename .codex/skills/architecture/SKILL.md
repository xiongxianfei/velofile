# Architecture Package Authoring

You are making the technical design visible before implementation.

The architecture artifact explains how the repository or system is shaped to satisfy the spec. It should expose structure, runtime flow, deployment impact, cross-cutting rules, quality concerns, risks, and durable decisions without becoming an execution task list.

## Inputs to read

Read, if present:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `CONSTITUTION.md`
- accepted proposal
- approved feature spec and spec-review findings
- `specs/architecture-package-method.md` when architecture package shape is in scope
- canonical architecture package under `docs/architecture/system/`
- change-local architecture delta under `docs/changes/<change-id>/architecture.md`
- related ADRs under `docs/adr/`
- research artifacts and `docs/project-map.md`
- existing source interfaces, schemas, APIs, modules, CI, deployment config

## Output Shape

Produce or update:

- `docs/changes/<change-id>/architecture.md` for change-local deltas, or
- the canonical architecture package when maintaining the baseline;
- C4 system context diagram;
- C4 container diagram;
- ADRs when durable decisions are introduced.

Use `templates/architecture.md` for the full 12-section arc42 structure. Use `templates/diagram-styles.mmd` for Mermaid flowchart or graph C4 role styles. Use `templates/adr.md` for ADR structure.

Full worked examples, if needed, belong outside this skill body, for example in `skills/architecture/references/architecture-example.md`.

## When to Use / When Not to Use

Use the approved C4, arc42, and ADR method when architecture work is required.

Use architecture work when the change affects multiple components, data flow, generated-output flow, deployment, packaging, adapters, quality targets, cross-cutting rules, security boundaries, or durable decisions.

Do not create or update architecture artifacts for leaf changes that do not affect architecture boundaries, data flow, generated-output flow, deployment, packaging, adapters, quality targets, cross-cutting rules, or durable decisions. Record a no-architecture-impact rationale in the plan, test spec, change metadata, or PR evidence instead.

Canonical current architecture lives at:

```text
docs/architecture/system/architecture.md
docs/architecture/system/diagrams/context.mmd
docs/architecture/system/diagrams/container.mmd
```

Change-local working architecture lives at:

```text
docs/changes/<change-id>/architecture.md
docs/changes/<change-id>/diagrams/
```

Use a change-local architecture delta only when the change is architecture-significant enough to need reviewable working design reasoning before accepted content is merged into the canonical package. A change-local delta is not a competing canonical source. After acceptance, merge durable content back into the canonical package and leave the delta as historical evidence only.

## arc42 Sections

The canonical `architecture.md` uses repository lifecycle metadata before all 12 official arc42 sections. Keep sections concise; use `Not applicable` only with a short rationale. Do not remove or rename official arc42 sections to make the document lighter.

Use the template for section structure. In the skill output, name only the sections changed or explicitly unaffected with rationale.

Update section 6 when behavior, orchestration, failure paths, command flow, generated-output flow, or operational flow changes. Update section 7 when environments, packaging, generated outputs, adapters, release layout, infrastructure, or execution boundaries change. Update section 8 when validation, security, caching, portability, generation, observability, or other cross-cutting rules change. Section 9 is always present and either links ADRs or states that no ADRs are required for the update.

## C4 Guidance

Default required C4 diagrams for the canonical package:

- system context diagram: `docs/architecture/system/diagrams/context.mmd`
- container diagram: `docs/architecture/system/diagrams/container.mmd`

Use separate Mermaid `.mmd` source files for default diagrams and link them from `architecture.md` with relative Markdown links. Do not embed package diagrams in Markdown. For Mermaid flowchart or graph diagrams, use `templates/diagram-styles.mmd` or an explicitly equivalent copied block so people, systems, external systems, and containers are distinguishable.

Add a component diagram only when container-level structure is not enough to explain changed responsibilities, internal boundaries, or interactions. Add a deployment diagram only when infrastructure, runtime environment, packaging, adapter distribution, or deployment mapping needs visual explanation beyond arc42 section 7.

Update the lowest affected C4 level first, then propagate upward only when the higher-level view actually changes. Do not make generated images, screenshots, or external diagram links the only source of truth.

Minimal context snippet:

```mermaid
C4Context
  Person(contributor, "Contributor or agent")
  System(repo, "RigorLoop repository")
  Rel(contributor, repo, "Authors and reviews architecture artifacts")
```

Minimal container snippet:

```mermaid
C4Container
  Person(contributor, "Contributor or agent")
  System_Boundary(repo, "RigorLoop repository") {
    Container(skills, "Canonical skills", "Markdown", "Authoring source")
    Container(templates, "Architecture templates", "Markdown/Mermaid", "Scaffolds architecture packages")
  }
  Rel(contributor, skills, "Updates")
  Rel(skills, templates, "References")
```

Keep diagrams small and accurate. Prefer multiple focused diagrams over one unreadable diagram.

## ADR Triggers

Create an ADR when the change introduces or revises a durable architecture decision, including:

- system boundary changes
- adapter generation or packaging rules
- validation architecture
- cache or indexing strategy
- portability constraints
- release architecture
- major workflow architecture decisions

Use `templates/adr.md` and store real ADRs under `docs/adr/`. Each ADR includes title, status, context, decision, alternatives considered, consequences, and follow-up.

Accepted or active ADRs are decision history. Later changes should supersede or deprecate an old ADR with a new ADR or explicit lifecycle update rather than rewriting the old decision as if it had always been different.

## Authoring Rules

- Update only the arc42 sections and C4 views the change actually affects.
- Merge accepted durable content from change-local deltas into the canonical package before an architecture-significant change is complete.
- Keep legacy `docs/architecture/` documents as legacy or historical context until the legacy normalization artifact classifies them.
- Do not write an execution milestone list here; use `plan` after design review.
- Do not hide tradeoffs.
- Do not introduce architecture that the spec does not require.
- Do not change behavior in the architecture doc without updating the spec.
- Do not claim compatibility, rollback, or performance safety without explaining the mechanism.
- Do not use `reviewed` as a durable architecture status. Once the design is relied on, normalize the tracked artifact to `approved` or the appropriate terminal state.
- Preserve `Next artifacts` as planning history. Use `Follow-on artifacts` for actual downstream artifacts, replacement, or terminal closeout.
- If an architecture document is superseded, identify the replacement with `superseded_by` or equivalent labeled text.
- Do not include secrets, credentials, private keys, tokens, or machine-local debug-only data.

## Evidence Collection Efficiency

Use summary and stable-ID first reasoning before broad reads or raw excerpts. Prefer check IDs, requirement IDs, section numbers, ADR IDs, diagram paths, file paths, and line citations. Read exact sections first, then expand only when the narrower evidence cannot answer the architecture question.

## Workflow handoff behavior

- In a workflow-managed flow, successful `architecture` completion hands off to `architecture-review` when that review is the next required or default downstream stage.
- If the design still has open questions that block safe review, stop and report the blocker instead of implying `architecture-review` can proceed.
- This v1 contract does not imply `architecture-review -> plan`; review-to-next-authoring transitions remain outside the autoprogression boundary unless a later approved change adds them.

## When full-file read is required

Read the full file when creating or replacing the canonical architecture package, when the whole file is the review target, when checking all 12 arc42 headings or lifecycle metadata, when merge-back may affect multiple sections, when superseding or deprecating an ADR, when legacy status affects the conclusion, when the relevant section cannot be isolated safely, when bounded searches disagree, or when a behavior-changing edit depends on the whole source-of-truth artifact.

## Expected output

- canonical architecture package path or change-local delta path;
- changed arc42 sections and C4 diagram paths;
- requirement-to-architecture mapping;
- ADR paths for durable decisions, or a clear no-ADR-required rationale;
- merge-back status for change-local deltas;
- alternatives, consequences, risks, quality concerns, deployment impact, and security/privacy notes where relevant;
- readiness statement for `architecture-review` or blocker state.
